# PomodoroTimer
A MicroObject Pomodoro Timer

# InterfaceMocks
This is a framework for fakes in unit tests. It's been pulled in from github.com/fyzxs/IMock repository. It's a Mock/Fake framework that evolved out of using MicroObjects. 


# ConsolePomodoro
This is my initial experimentation platform. It doesn't do the full thing.

# PomodoroTimerDesktop
This is the primary application for the pomodor timer. CI/CD isn't configured yet.
Tests aren't fully written yet.

# PomodoroTimerLib
This is intended to hold all the core functionality of running the timers. Allowing a thin UI on top to work in multiple environments. Theory is good...
Currently the implementation in PomodoroTimerDesktop has some tight coupling. That will need to be worked out before the dream can happen.
